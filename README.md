# ghost
*Philip Bull, 2016*

`ghost` is a simple analytic model for how galaxies occupy dark matter halos, and the emission of those galaxies over multiple different wavelengths.

It works by connecting basic physical properties of the galaxies to the halo mass, using empirical scaling relations (described by parametrised pdfs). Emission properties of the galaxies are linked to those physical properties by another set of scaling relations (and appropriate pdfs).

The parameters of the model can be fitted against data or simulations. Some simple likelihoods and MCMC scripts are provided for this.
